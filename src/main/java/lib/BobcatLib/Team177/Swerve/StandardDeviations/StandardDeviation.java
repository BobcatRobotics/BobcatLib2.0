  /**
   * standard deviations are how much our vision measurements tend to be off by, or basically how
   * much we trust the vision measurements. Higher numbers mean the measurements are usually off by
   * more, and we trust them less, lower numbers means that the measurements are off by less.
   *
   * <p>there are two standard deviations, with two variants each, these impact vision measurements.
   *
   * <p>
   *
   * <p>Position is your (x,y) coordinates on the field
   *
   * <p>Theta is your heading in radians
   *
   * <p>Trust std devs are used when we have reliable data, distrust are for when we have unreliable
   * data (i.e. the robot can only see one tag)
